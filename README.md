# Machine-Learning-model-for-Pima-Indians-Diabetes-Database

- This problem statement took from 10 Standard Datasets for Practicing Applied Machine Learning.
- The Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset involves predicting the onset of diabetes within 5 years in Pima Indians given medical details.
- Basically, this is a machine learning model implemented in python which is based on Pima Indians Diabetes Database.
- As we can see this falls under classification category therefore, this machine learning model is based on Random Forest Classifier 
algorithm.

# Variables involved :

1. Number of times pregnant.
2. Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.
3. Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
4. Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).
5. 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
6. Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
7. Diabetes pedigree function.
8. Age (years).
9. Class variable (0 or 1).

# Overview of Process :

- Import required libraries
- Import Dataset.
- Taking care of missing data.
- Split dataset into training and test set.
- Apply suitable classifier.
- Predit results.
- Compare results.
